# Youtube-Channel-Recommendation-Network
We have two primary goals for this project:- \
The first one is to discover the structure behind these three networks. We will 
find different properties of each network like centrality measures, degree and 
motifs. \
The second goal is to compare the three models based on these properties. 
Using this, we hope to shed light on the network structure that YouTube 
recommendation used.
